## The workshop

### Presenters

- Andy Nicholls, GSK
- Marly Gotti, Biogen

### Overview

In this workshop we will walk through an implementation of the R Validation Hub's white paper: [A Risk-based Approach for Assessing R Package Accuracy within a Validated Infrastructure](https://www.pharmar.org/white-paper/). The workshop will explore two core themes:

1. R Packages Risk Assessment
2. Testing 

In part 1, we will use a small set of pre-selected R packages to see how the R Validation Hub's Risk Assessment Application and the [riskmetric](https://pharmar.github.io/riskmetric/articles/riskmetric.html) R package can be used to create risk assessment reports for an R package.

In part 2, we will discuss how testing can be used to reduce the risk for those packages with high risk. In particular, we will discuss the testing philosophy with respect to software validation and demonstrate how the `testthat` package can be used to perform the necessary steps to test traceability requirements.

## Prerequisites

Prior knowledge of the basic structure of R packages is required for the second part of this workshop.

## Prepare for the workshop

Before the workshop, we will send out a link to the RStudio Cloud space we will use for the workshop. After clicking the link you will be prompted to log in or create an account if you do not have one. Afterwards click the button to 'Join Space'. On the Projects tab, you will see the project '??', which we will use in class.

## More information

R Validation Hub is a cross-industry initiative whose mission
is to enable the use of R by the Bio-Pharmaceutical Industry in a regulatory setting, where the output may be used in submissions to regulatory agencies.
